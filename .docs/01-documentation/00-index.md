# Documentation

Standardising VCF file handeling for accurate analysis and post-processing
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

<hr/>

This workflow includes a number of tools and processing steps intended to help researchers handle and process VCF files using standardized techniques.

## Use-Cases

This workflow is intended to be used as part of a larger analysis, to standardize VCF file preparation for downstream work.

## Goals

The underlying goal behind this workflow is to establish and provide a stable platform on which to iterate over VCF file handeling techniques in an easy-to-reference and easy-to-expand framework. Our goal with this repository is to bring stability and direction to the development of standardised file-handeling when it comes to VCF files, which are a common source of genotype data used in many studies.
