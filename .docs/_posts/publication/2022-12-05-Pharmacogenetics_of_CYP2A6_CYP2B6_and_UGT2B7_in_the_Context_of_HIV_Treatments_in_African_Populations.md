# Abstract

**Objectives:** This study focuses on identifying variations in selected CYP genes related to treatment responses in patients with HIV in African populations by investigating variant characteristics and effects in African cohorts. **Design:** Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2A6, 2B6, and Uridine 5â€™-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 allele frequencies were studied using public-domain datasets obtained from the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 project, the African Genome Variation Project (AGVP), and the South African Human Genome Programme (SAHGP). **Methods:** Variant annotations were performed using<!--end sample--> self-identified ethnicities to conduct allele frequency analysis in a population-stratification-sensitive manner. The NCBI DB-SNP database was used to identify documented variants and standard frequencies, and the E! Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor tool was used to perform the prediction of possible deleterious variants. **Results:** A total of 4468 variants were identified across 3676 individuals following pre-filtering. Seventy-one variants were identified at an allelic frequency (1% or more in at least one population), which were predicted to be linked to existing disease associations and, in some cases, linked to drug metabolisms. This list was further studied to identify 23 alleles with disease considerations found at significantly different frequencies in one or more populations. **Conclusions:** This study describes allele frequencies observed in African populations at significantly different frequencies relative to at least one other reference population and identifies a subset of variants of clinical interest. Despite the inclusion of mixed sequence coverage datasets, the variants identified pose notable avenues for future inquiries. A subset of variants of clinical interest with statistically significant inter-population frequency differences was identified for further inspection, which provides evidence of an African population-specific variant frequency profile. This study highlights the need for additional research and African genetics data given the presence of this unique frequency profile to better facilitate the genetic pre-screening of patients as a standard of practice in HIV care, particularly on the African continent where HIV is highly prevalent.
